# myAgro Overview

## Model

myAgro sells agricultural inputs (fertilizer and seed) on layaway via a mobile phone platform and a network of local village vendors.

**Stores**: We partner with local village stores and create a trusted network. Vendors sell our scratch-cards to farmers when they come in to buy their other household goods. Banks are usually too far and too expensive for rural farmers to access.

**Mobile Layaway**: myAgro helps small-scale farmers in West Africa pay on layaway for fertilizer, seed and training packages using their mobile phone, similar to how people buy talk-time for their phone in developing countries. Registered farmers can save easily by continuously “topping up” their myAgro account in flexible amounts ($1 – $50) by buying additional cards.

**Training**: myAgro agents provide training in modern farming methods contextualized for the African farm.

- We provide micro-dose fertilizer trainings.
- Planting trainings for our different seed varieties.
- Animal drawn seeder training.
- Off-season vegetable training.

**Income**: Our goal is to push myAgro farmers beyond subsistence farming and help them earn more than $4/day (our impact plus their own current earnings of $2/day). myAgro farmers will have more flexible income to deal with economic shocks, take care of family needs and re-invest in their farms.

## How it works

- Farmers register with myAgro at harvest time and plan their goals for the following season (6-9 months away).
- Farmers receive a unique customer ID from myAgro.
- Farmers buy myAgro cards from their local store and send an SMS with the secret code on the back of the card and their customer ID.
- We receive their SMS and add their data to our database to calculate: the value of the card they purchased, the total in their account and progress towards their goal.
- We respond back to the farmer to thank them for their purchase along with an update on their progress to date.
- Then at planting time, fertilizer and seed are delivered that match their savings.
- Throughout the whole time, training sessions also occur.

## Terminology

- Geography
    - Zone -- area covered with many villages and farmers
    - Village -- group of 10s-100s of people, using including a local store. There are many villages within 1 zone.
- People
    - Farmer -- typically lives in a village and owns a small parcel of land
    - Vendor -- each village has one (usually), and they sell scratch cards in their village
    - Agent -- the first point of contact for a farmer. They manage contracts, go to the field, collects money, and track data. They have 1 or more villages and vendors they work with.
    - Field Supervisor -- manages Agents, and may run training sessions.
    - Field Coordinator -- manages Field Supervisors and larger activities in a area.

## More detailed breakdown of process

- New Season setup
    - HQ person manages vendor program (recruitment, training, onboarding)
    - create all ID cards in the system
    - contracts are printed with ID numbers/cards
        - if unknown, still assign ID
    - agents do marketing/advertising for myagro (bi-weekly basis)
    - farmers attend meetings and sign name to indicate interest
- Enrollment
    - new village/area
    - enrollment begins
    - Farmer fills out contract including bio, savings goal (usually hectare size, seeds)
    - pay initial fee (using card)
    - vendor sends SMS and now you get credit
    - existing farmers already have info
    - new farmers now have ID, and waiting on data entry for remaining contract info
    - every Monday, contracts are returned to office
    - then data entry happens
- Savings
    - on regular basis (weekly), farmer buys card from vendor
    - vendor sends SMS for card buy
    - vendor receives SMS confirmation
    - savings goals updated
    - agents collect money from vendors
        - agents fill out receipts when they do so
        - agents deposit this money with Orange Money (like MPesa)
        - bring back receipt to office for data entry
- Input Delivery
    - if goal met, inputs delivered
    - if goal not met, farmer can choose:
        - to take input delivery on partial amount
        - use balance to save for next year (only can use 1 year forward)
        - reimbursed
- Monitoring and Evaluation
    - right before harvest, measure (including control groups)
- Reporting and Auditing

## Key Technology Issues

- Internet access isn't reliable or fast
- Electricity isn't reliable
- Skilled data entry people are hard to find
- Data entry can only be simplified so far
- Need to have multiple checks and balances, especially for anything involving money
- Getting data from zones to HQ isn't simple
- HQ wants reports as often as possible
- Finding, hiring, and retaining tech and finance people is hard, so tools have to be transferable
